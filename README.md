Here I have created a stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


In HTML, I have take a container name stopwatch and in that i have add a timer div to display the time of the stop watch 
and 3 buttons that corresponds to start, stop and reset.

In Java scrip, I have selected the stopwatch container elements using the query selector and then add the click functionality on them.
Start button:  on click the start button the timer start for the phase where it was initiated or stopped (using stop button).
Stop button:  on click the stop button the timer stop at a particular time and again start from that point of time only when it is stopped.
Start button:  on click the reset button the timer start from its initial phase ie from (00:00).
